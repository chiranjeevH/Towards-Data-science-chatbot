# Towards-Data-science-chatbot

## Project Overview

The Towards-Data-Science Chatbot is a Python-based chatbot project designed to interact with users and respond to various queries related to data science and related topics. The chatbot utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the `nltk` library for text processing and understanding user input. Additionally, the chatbot employs TensorFlow and the `tflearn` library to build a deep learning model for predicting appropriate responses based on user queries.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The chatbot utilizes the `nltk` library to process user input, tokenize text, and perform stemming for better understanding of queries.

- **Deep Learning Model**: The project builds a deep learning model using TensorFlow and `tflearn` to train the chatbot for predicting responses based on user queries.

## Getting Started

To use this chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Towards-Data-Science-Chatbot.git`.

2. Install the required Python libraries by running:
   - `pip install nltk`
   - `pip install tflearn`
   - `pip install tensorflow`

3. Download the necessary NLTK data by running `nltk.download('punkt')`.

4. Execute the Python script to train the chatbot and save the model


## Data

The project uses the `intents.json` file to store intent patterns and responses for training the chatbot.

## Model

The trained chatbot model is saved as `model.tflearn`, which is used for predicting responses.
